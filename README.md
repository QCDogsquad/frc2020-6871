# Team 6871 FRC 2020 Robot Code

This is the source code for the Frist Robotics Competition Team 6871, QC Dogsquad. We did not get to compete during the 2020 game season, because of the Covid-19 epidemic. This is the code that was written, but lacking in several domains. This robot does not actually have an autonomous mode as we were unable to get that far during the 2020 season.
